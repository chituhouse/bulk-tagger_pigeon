This image features a light blue background with two distinct geometric shapes and a text caption. In the upper left quadrant, there is a red rectangle outlined in red. The rectangle is empty, with no fill color, and its borders are clearly defined. Below the rectangle, centrally positioned, is the text "Test Image for MiniMax Tagger" written in a standard sans-serif font, likely Arial or Helvetica, in black color. The text is horizontally aligned and of moderate size, making it easily readable against the light blue background.

In the lower right quadrant of the image, there is a green ellipse outlined in green. Similar to the rectangle, the ellipse is empty with no fill color, and its borders are clearly defined. The ellipse is slightly larger than the rectangle and positioned such that it balances the composition of the image.

The overall style of the image is minimalistic and clean, with a focus on simple geometric shapes and clear text. The use of primary colors (red and green) for the shapes contrasts effectively with the light blue background, creating a visually appealing and easily interpretable image. The composition is balanced, with the shapes and text distributed evenly across the image, ensuring that no single element overwhelms the others. This image appears to be a test or example image, likely used for demonstration or testing purposes related to the MiniMax Tagger.
